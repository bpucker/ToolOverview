# Plant Genomics Tool Overview

A large number of tools is available for various tasks in plant genomics. This repository provides an overview about available (and recommended) tools in plant genomics. This is based on the experiences of the [Plant Biotechnology and Biotechnology](https://www.tu-braunschweig.de/en/ifp/pbb) research group at TU Braunschweig. If you are new to plant genomics, our ['Data Literacy in Plant Genomics'](https://doi.org/10.1515/jib-2023-0033) course might be of interest to you.
